                          Pulse Width Modulation
 Demonstrates Fast Pulse Width Modulation by slowly increasing the brightness
 of an LED connected to PWM pin 6 and slowly decreasing the brightnes of 
 the LED connected to Pin 6.
 
 LED connected to Pin D5(pin 5) increases gradually in brightness
 LED connected to Pin D6(pin 6) decreases gradually in brightness
